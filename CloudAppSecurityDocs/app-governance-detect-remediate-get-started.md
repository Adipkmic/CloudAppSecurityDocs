# Get started with app threat detection and remediation

App governance collects threat alerts that are generated by built-in, machine-learning-driven app governance detection methods based on malicious app activities and policy-based alerts generated by active app policies that you create.

The first place to view app alerts is the app governance dashboard at [https://aka.ms/appgovernance](https://aka.ms/appgovernance).

On this overview page, the **Latest alerts** section lists the most recent alerts. You can use this to quickly see the current app alert activity for your tenant.

To see all of the alerts, select the **Alerts** tab.

## Whatâ€™s available on the Alerts page

The **Alerts** page lists all of the app governance-based alerts for your tenant.

Each listed alert has the following information:

- **Alert name**: The type of anomalous behavior.
- **App name**: The app that generated the alert.
- **Severity**: The severity assigned by app governance for alerts it creates or the severity of the app policy that generated the alert.
- **Source**: Origination of the alert, which can be results from policy (user-created policies), detection (built-in detection policies), or Defender for Cloud Apps.
- **Status**: **New** indicates an alert that hasn't been assigned a status. Once assigned, the status is either **In progress** while being investigated or **Resolved** for alerts that have been addressed through automatic or manual remediation.
- **Date created**: The date the alert was generated by either app governance detection or through an app policy. All dates shown are in the local time zone of the Microsoft 365 Defender.
- **Last activity**: The date the status of the alert was last changed. All dates shown are in the local time zone of the Microsoft 365 Defender.

The alert list is sorted by **Date created** by default. To sort the list by another attribute, select the attribute name.

You can also export the current alert list to a comma-separated value (CSV) file. For example, you could open the CVS file in Microsoft Excel and sort the list of alerts by **Severity** and then **Date Created**.
