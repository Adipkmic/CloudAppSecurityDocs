# Microsoft Defender for Identity integration

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integrates with Microsoft Defender for Identity to provide user entity behavioral analytics (UEBA) across a hybrid environment - both cloud app and on-premises, for more information, see [Tutorial: Investigate risky users](tutorial-ueba.md). For more information about the machine learning and behavioral analytics provided by Defender for Identity, see [What is Defender for Identity?](/defender-for-identity/what-is)

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Cloud Apps does not send email notifications for Defender for Identity alerts. However, you can configure email notifications for them in the Defender for Identity portal.

- A valid license for Microsoft Defender for Identity connected to your Active Directory instance
- You must be an Azure Active Directory global admin to enable integration between Defender for Identity and Defender for Cloud Apps

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you don't have a subscription for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, you will still be able to use Defender for Cloud Apps to get Defender for Identity insights.
