# Security posture management for SaaS apps

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

Your SaaS application environments may be configured in a risky posture. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps provides you with risk security configuration assessments for your SaaS applications to make sure you prevent possible risks. These recommendations are shown via [Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-security-recommendation) once you have a connector to an application. You should connect an app to Defender for Cloud Apps. For the connection guide,  see [connecting an app pages](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md). The security recommendations will be shown automatically in [Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-security-recommendation).

>[!NOTE]
>
> - SaaS Security Posture Management for non-Microsoft applications is currently in public preview for every customer with Defender for Cloud Apps. At General Availability the licensing of this capability may be changed.
> - Currently only specific applications are supported with this functionality. Supported applications can be found at [connected apps](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md#user-app-governance-and-security-configuration-visibility).
> - Currently, it's possible to configure one instance for each app.
> - The recommendations are based on Microsoft benchmarks.
